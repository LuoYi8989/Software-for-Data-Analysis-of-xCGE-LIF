# Software-for-Data-Analysis-of-xCGE-LIF

This software is an open-source software for the processing of data generated by analysis of glycans by xCGE-LIF. It is developed in python.

The software has two main functions. One is to develop glycan-based standards database and the other is to analyse raw data from the measured samples and assign konwn glycan species of the database to measured signals by comparing the time points of signals to those deposited in the migration time database.

The "User Manual" introduces how to use the software, the first chapter introduces the structure of the software, and the second chapter uses a sample data to introduce the software functions. The appendix describes how to install the software.
